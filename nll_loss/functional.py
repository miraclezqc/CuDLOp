     Args:
        input: :math:`(N, C)` where `C = number of classes` or :math:`(N, C, H, W)`
            in case of 2D Loss, or :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` where :math:`K \geq 1`
            in the case of K-dimensional loss. `input` is expected to be log-probabilities.
        target: :math:`(N)` where each value is :math:`0 \leq \text{targets}[i] \leq C-1`,
            or :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` where :math:`K \geq 1` for
            K-dimensional loss.
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each
            class. If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets. Default: -100
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
